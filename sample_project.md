**The Big Business of Food Delivery - Using Excel to look deeper into data**

Hard at work at my first teaching job, packing food before class was the last thing on my to-do list; I frequently found myself sipping coffee or munching on peanuts for lunch. Flash forward, I watched in awe as my colleagues had various hot+steamy dishes served by courier directly to their desks.

Times have changed, and the convenience of a food delivery service has allowed me some peaceful experiences, like staying at an Airbnb without renting a car or having a cozy rainy-day Sunday. 

McKinsey & Company reports that the food delivery business has become a global market worth more than $150 Billion. I went to dig into the data for details. 

**Here are some takeaways:**
•	15% of the customers brought in 32% of the revenues
•	Over half of the amount spent was on wine
•	When considering revenues, it might be deceptive to consider the number of purchases

**Data Source**
Based on actual data from a food delivery company in Brazil, this dataset was given to candidates as a case study for an interview. The spreadsheet contains information about 2,021 different iFood customers, each row representing a customer and each of the 37 columns containing a feature or descriptor of the customer, such as education level, amount/type of purchases, family structure, or age.

**Analysis**
They must have referred to a histogram when they said, "A picture tells a thousand words," as this is a significant first step in analyzing data.
